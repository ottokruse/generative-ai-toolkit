###
# Example runner for Pydantic-based LLM tools with Generative AI Toolkit.

# This module demonstrates how to:
# 1. Create a Generative AI Toolkit agent
# 2. Register a Pydantic-based tool (WeatherAlertsTool)
# 3. Process natural language requests through the agent
# 4. Handle tool responses in a conversational context

# The examples show how the agent understands user intent and uses the tool appropriately.
